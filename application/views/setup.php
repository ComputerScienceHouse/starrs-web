			STARRS is designed to handle a variety of different network setups and reduce administrative overhead. These are the basic objects that you as an administrator need to configure for a new installation. After configuring one or more of each object, proceed on to the next. Attempting to configure objects out of order will result in errors.

			There are several key variables that you need to configure to make your installation work. You can find these under Management->Configuration on the navigation bar. Once you have configured these, you can proceed with the basic setup. Failure to configure these variables will result in unintended operation as many key functions depend on them.

		<div class="container">
			Datacenters are broken into several different Availability Zones. These allow you to further classify your resources depending on other organizational criteria. For example, some systems might be in a Production AZ while others are located in a Development AZ.

		<div class="container">
			Your hosts in a datacenter are broken up into multiple VLANs across your switching infrastructure. STARRS will track your VLANs so you know where devices are in your network. You can also view switchport assignments and CAM tables based on the VLANs you configure.

		<div class="container">
			To manage your DNS zones, STARRS uses TSIG keys to send updates to your authoritative nameservers. This allows for easy one-stop management of DNS records in your zones. Users can even create certain records for their own systems if their application depends on them.
